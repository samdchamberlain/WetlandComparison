	abstract = {The higher-order scalar concentration fluctuation properties are examined in the context of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory for a variety of greenhouse gases that have distinct and separate source/sink locations along an otherwise ideal micrometeorological field site. Air temperature and concentrations of water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane were measured at high frequency (10 Hz) above a flat and extensive peat-land soil in the San Joaquin–Sacramento Delta (California, {USA}) area, subjected to year-round grazing by beef cattle. Because of the heterogeneous distribution of the sources and sinks of {CO}2 and especially {CH}4 emitted by cattle, the scaling behaviour of the higher-order statistical properties diverged from predictions based on a balance between their production and dissipation rate terms, which can obtained for temperature and H2O during stationary conditions. We identify and label these departures as ‘exogenous’ because they depend on heterogeneities and non-stationarities induced by boundary conditions on the flow. Spectral analysis revealed that the exogenous effects show their signatures in regions with frequencies lower than those associated with scalar vertical transport by turbulence, though the two regions may partially overlap in some cases. Cospectra of vertical fluxes appear less influenced by these exogenous effects because of the modulating role of the vertical velocity at low frequencies. Finally, under certain conditions, the presence of such exogenous factors in higher-order scalar fluctuation statistics may be ‘fingerprinted’ by a large storage term in the mean scalar budget.},

Experimental tests and ecosystem observations have demonstrated the important role density corrections play in accurately quantifying carbon dioxide ({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CO}\}\_\{2\})({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CO}\}\_\{2\}) fluxes, but less attention has been paid to evaluating these corrections for methane ({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\})({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}) fluxes. We measured {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} fluxes with open-path sensors over a suite of sites with contrasting {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} emissions and energy partitioning, including a pavement airfield, two negligible-flux ecosystems (drained alfalfa and pasture), and two high-flux ecosystems (flooded wetland and rice). We found that density corrections successfully re-zeroed fluxes in negligible-flux sites; however, slight overcorrection was observed above pavement. The primary impact of density corrections varied over negligible- and high-flux ecosystems. For negligible-flux sites, corrections led to greater than 100\% adjustment in daily budgets, while these adjustments were only 3–10\% in high-flux ecosystems. The primary impact to high-flux ecosystems was a change in flux diel patterns, which may affect the evaluation of relationships between biophysical drivers and fluxes if correction bias exists. Additionally, accounting for density effects to high-frequency {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} fluctuations led to large differences in observed {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} flux cospectra above negligible-flux sites, demonstrating that similar adjustments should be made before interpreting {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} cospectra for comparable ecosystems. These results give us confidence in {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} fluxes measured by open-path sensors, and demonstrate that density corrections play an important role in adjusting flux budgets and diel patterns across a range of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration ({ET}) can be difficult to interpret and use for validating model calculations in the presence of land cover heterogeneity. Land surface fluxes, soil moisture (θ), and surface temperatures (Ts) data were collected by an eddy correlation-based tower located at the Orroli (Sardinia) experimental field (covered by woody vegetation, grass, and bare soil) from April 2003 to July 2004. Two Quickbird high-resolution images (summer 2003 and spring 2004) were acquired for depicting the contrasting land cover components. A procedure is presented for estimating {ET} in heterogeneous ecosystems as the residual term of the energy balance using Ts observations, a two-dimensional footprint model, and the Quickbird images. Two variations on the procedure are successfully implemented: a proposed two-source random model (2SR), which treats the heat sources of each land cover component separately but computes the bulk heat transfer coefficient as spatially homogeneous, and a common two-source tile model. For 2SR, new relationships between the interfacial transfer coefficient and the roughness Reynolds number are estimated for the two bare soil–woody vegetation and grass–woody vegetation composite surfaces. The {ET} versus θ relationships for each land cover component were also estimated, showing that that the woody vegetation has a strong tolerance to long droughts, transpiring at rates close to potential for even the driest conditions. Instead, the grass is much less tolerant to θ deficits, and the switch from grass to bare soil following the rainy season had a significant impact on {ET}.},

The main advantage of this model is its ability to analytically relate atmospheric stability, measurement height, and surface roughness length to flux and footprint. Flux estimation by the proposed model was in good agreement with those calculated by detailed Eulerian and Lagrangian models. Measured water vapor fluxes collected along a downwind transect of a transition from a desert to an irrigated potato site were also used to assess the proposed model performance in the field. It was found that the model well reproduced the measured flux evolution with downwind distance.},

	abstract = {It is necessary to partition eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange into its offsetting gross fluxes, canopy photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration, to understand the biophysical controls on the net fluxes. And independent estimates of canopy photosynthesis (G) and ecosystem respiration (R) are needed to validate and parametrize carbon cycle models that are coupled with climate and ecosystem dynamics models. Yet there is a concern that carbon flux partitioning methods may suffer from spurious correlation because derived values of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration both contain common information on net carbon fluxes at annual time scales.
We hypothesized that spurious correlation among canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration can be minimized using day–night conditional sampling of {CO}2 exchange; daytime fluxes are dominated by photosynthesis and nighttime fluxes are dominated by respiration. To test this hypothesis, we derived explicit equations that quantify the degree of spurious correlation between photosynthesis and respiration. Theoretically, day and night samples of net carbon exchange share a different common variable, daytime ecosystem respiration, and the degree of spurious correlation depends upon the variance of this shared variable.
We then applied this theory to ideal measurements of carbon exchange of over a vigorous, irrigated, and frequently harvested alfalfa field in the sunny and windy region of California, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where soil {CO}2 efflux is strong. In this case, we found that the correlation coefficient between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration was −0.79. This relatively high correlation between canopy photosynthesis and respiration was mostly real as the degree of spurious correlation was only −0.32.
We then expanded this analysis to the {FLUXNET} database that spans a spectrum of climate and plant functional types. We found, on average, that the correlation between gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, using day–night sampling, was close to minus one (−0.828 ± 0.130). For perspective, a large fraction of this correlation was real, as the degree of spurious correlation (Eq. (22)) was −0.526. We conclude that the potential for spurious correlation between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration across the {FLUXNET} database was moderate. Looking across the database, we found that the least negative spurious correlations coefficients (\&gt;−0.3) were associated with seasonal deciduous forests. The most negative spurious correlations coefficients (\&lt;−0.7) were associated with evergreen forests found in boreal climates.},

We determine the large sample distribution for both estimators and show that the maximal-overlap estimator is more efficient for a class of processes of interest in the physical sciences. We discuss methods for determining an approximate confidence interval for the wavelet variance. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo experiments that the large sample distribution for the maximal-overlap estimator is a reasonable approximation even for the moderate sample size of 128 observations.

	shorttitle = {Greenhouse carbon balance of wetlands},
	abstract = {Carbon fixation under wetland anaerobic soil conditions provides unique conditions for long-term storage of carbon into histosols. However, this carbon sequestration process is intimately linked to methane emission from wetlands. The potential contribution of this emitted methane to the greenhouse effect can be mitigated by the removal of atmospheric {CO}2 and storage into peat. The balance of {CH}4 and {CO}2 exchange can provide an index of a wetland’s greenhouse gas (carbon) contribution to the atmosphere. Here, we relate the atmospheric global warming potential of methane ({GWPM}) with annual methane emission/carbon dioxide exchange ratio of wetlands ranging from the boreal zone to the near-subtropics. This relationship permits one to determine the greenhouse carbon balance of wetlands by their contribution to or attenuation of the greenhouse effect via {CH}4 emission or {CO}2 sink, respectively. We report annual measurements of the relationship between methane emission and net carbon fixation in three wetland ecosystems. The ratio of methane released to annual net carbon fixed varies from 0.05 to 0.20 on a molar basis. Although these wetlands function as a sink for {CO}2, the 21.8-fold greater infrared absorptivity of {CH}4 relative to {CO}2({GWPM}) over a relatively short time horizon (20 years) would indicate that the release of methane still contributes to the overall greenhouse effect. As {GWPM} decreases over longer time horizons (100 years), our analyses suggest that the subtropical and temperate wetlands attenuate global warming, and northern wetlands may be perched on the “greenhouse compensation” point. Considering a 500-year time horizon, these wetlands can be regarded as sinks for greenhouse gas warming potential, and thus attenuate the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Humid tropical forests support large stocks of surface soil carbon (C) that exhibit high spatial variability over scales of meters to landscapes (km). Reactive minerals and organo-metal complexes are known to contribute to C accumulation in these ecosystems, although potential interactions with environmental factors such as oxygen (O2) availability have received much less attention. Reducing conditions can potentially contribute to C accumulation, yet anaerobic metabolic processes such as iron (Fe) reduction can also drive substantial C losses. We tested whether these factors could explain variation in soil C (0–10 and 10–20 cm depths) over multiple spatial scales in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using reduced iron (Fe({II})) concentrations as an index of reducing conditions across sites differing in vegetation, topographic position, and/or climate. Fine root biomass and Fe({II}) were the best overall correlates of site (n = 6) mean C concentrations and stocks from 0 to 20 cm depth (r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Litterfall decreased as reducing conditions, total and dead fine root biomass, and soil C increased among sites, suggesting that decomposition rates rather than C inputs regulated soil C content at the landscape scale. Strong relationships between Fe({II}) and dead fine root biomass suggest that reducing conditions suppressed particulate organic matter decomposition. The optimal mixed-effects regression model for individual soil samples (n = 149) showed that aluminum (Al) and Fe in citrate/ascorbate and oxalate extractions, Fe({II}), fine root biomass, and interactions between Fe({II}) and Al explained most of the variation in C concentrations (pseudo R2 = 0.82). The optimal model of C stocks was similar but did not include fine root biomass (pseudo R2 = 0.62). In these models, soil C concentrations and stocks increased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Al and oxalate-extractable Fe. However, soil C decreased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Fe, an index of Fe susceptible to anaerobic microbial reduction. At the site scale (n = 6), ratios of citrate/ascorbate to oxalate-extractable Fe consistently decreased across a landscape O2 gradient as C increased. We suggest that the impact of reducing conditions on organic matter decomposition and the presence of organo-metal complexes and C sorption by short-range order Fe and Al contribute to C accumulation, whereas the availability of an Fe pool to sustain anaerobic respiration in soil microsites partially attenuates soil C accumulation in these ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The availability of particulate Fe({III}) to iron reducing microbial communities in sediments and soils is generally inferred indirectly by performing chemical extractions. In this study, the bioavailability of mineral-bound Fe({III}) in intertidal sediments of a eutrophic estuary is assessed directly by measuring the kinetics and extent of Fe({III}) utilization by the iron reducing microorganism Shewanella putrefaciens, in the presence of excess electron donor. Microbial Fe({III}) reduction is compared to chemical dissolution of iron from the same sediments in buffered ascorbate-citrate solution ({pH} 7.5), ascorbic acid ({pH} 2), and 1M {HCl}. The results confirm that ascorbate at near-neutral {pH} selectively reduces the reactive Fe({III}) pool, while the acid extractants mobilize additional Fe({II}) and less reactive Fe({III}) mineral phases. Furthermore, the maximum concentrations of Fe({III}) reducible by S. putrefaciens correlate linearly with the iron concentrations extracted by buffered ascorbate-citrate solution, but not with those of the acid extractions. However, on average, only 65\% of the Fe({III}) reduced in buffered ascorbate-citrate solution can be utilized by S. putrefaciens, probably due to physical inaccessibility of the remaining fraction of reactive Fe({III}) to the cells. While the microbial and abiotic reaction kinetics further indicate that reduction by ascorbate at near-neutral {pH} most closely resembles microbial reduction of the sediment Fe({III}) pool by S. putrefaciens, the results also highlight fundamental differences between chemical reductive dissolution and microbial utilization of mineral-bound ferric iron.},

Upland humid tropical forests are also abundant in Fe and are characterized by high organic matter inputs, steep soil oxygen (O2) gradients, and fluctuating redox conditions, yielding concomitant methanogenesis and bacterial Fe({III}) reduction. However, whether Fe({III})-reducing bacteria coexist with methanogens or competitively suppress methanogenic acetate use in wet tropical soils is uncertain. To address this question, we conducted a process-based laboratory experiment to determine if competition for acetate between methanogens and Fe({III})-reducing bacteria influenced {CH}4 production and C isotope composition in humid tropical forest soils. We collected soils from a poor to moderately drained upland rain forest and incubated them with combinations of 13C-bicarbonate, 13C-methyl labeled acetate (13CH3COO−), poorly crystalline Fe({III}), or fluoroacetate. {CH}4 production showed a greater proportional increase than Fe2+ production after competition for acetate was alleviated, suggesting that Fe({III})-reducing bacteria were suppressing methanogenesis. Methanogenesis increased by approximately 67 times while Fe2+ production only doubled after the addition of 13CH3COO−. Large increases in both {CH}4 and Fe2+ production also indicate that the two process were acetate limited, suggesting that acetate may be a key substrate for anoxic carbon (C) metabolism in humid tropical forest soils. C isotope analysis suggests that competition for acetate was not the only factor driving {CH}4 production, as 13C partitioning did not vary significantly between 13CH3COO− and 13CH3COO−+Fe({III}) treatments. This suggests that dissimilatory Fe({III})-reduction suppressed both hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis. These findings have implications for understanding the {CH}4 biogeochemistry of highly weathered wet tropical soils, where {CH}4 efflux is driven largely by {CH}4 production.},

	abstract = {Soils are large sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases, and both the magnitude and composition of soil gas emissions are strongly controlled by redox conditions. Though the effect of redox dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions has been well studied in flooded soils, less research has focused on redox dynamics without total soil inundation. For the latter, all that is required are soil conditions where the rate of oxygen (O2) consumption exceeds the rate of atmospheric replenishment. We investigated the effects of soil anaerobiosis, generated with and without flooding, on greenhouse gas emissions and redox-sensitive biogeochemistry. We collected a Histosol from a regularly flooded peatland pasture and an Ultisol from a humid tropical forest where soil experiences frequent low redox events. We used a factorial design of flooding and anaerobic dinitrogen (N2) headspace treatments applied to replicate soil microcosms. An N2 headspace suppressed carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions by 50\% in both soils. Flooding, however, led to greater anaerobic {CO}2 emissions from the Ultisol. Methane emissions under N2 were also significantly greater with flooding in the Ultisol. Flooding led to very low N2O emissions after an initial pulse in the Histosol, while higher emission rates were maintained in control and N2 treatments. We conclude that soil greenhouse gas emissions are sensitive to the redox effects of O2 depletion as a driver of anaerobiosis and that flooding can have additional effects independent of O2 depletion. We emphasize that changes to the soil diffusive environment under flooding impacts transport of all gases, not only O2, and changes in dissolved solute availability under flooding may lead to increased mineralization of C.},

	abstract = {Wetland rice soils from Italy (Pavia) and the Philippines (Bugallon, Luisiana, Maligaya) were incubated under anoxic conditions at 31 different temperatures ranging from 4.7 °C to 49.5 °C. Production of {CO}2 was most intensive at the beginning of the incubation (0–4 days) and was predominantly coupled to the reduction of free Fe({III}). The optimum temperature for these processes was between 32 °C and 41 °C. After 9–16 days, {CO}2 production rates had decreased and the available Fe({III}) had been completely reduced at the optimum temperatures. However, Fe({III}) was still available at temperatures below and above the optimum. Maximum {CH}4 production rates were observed after 4–16 days (except in soil from Maligaya) with temperature optima between 32 °C and 41 °C, similar to those for {CO}2 production and Fe reduction. Since ongoing Fe reduction is known to suppress {CH}4 production, the temperature range of optimum {CH}4 production was restricted to those temperatures at which Fe({III}) had already been depleted. Nevertheless, the temperature characteristics of both {CO}2 and {CH}4 production often exhibited two temperature optima at some time during the incubation, suggesting a complex pattern of adaptation of the methanogenic microbial community to temperature. When available Fe({III}) was completely depleted by anoxic pre-incubation at 30 °C, {CH}4 was produced at a constant rate (steady state conditions) which increased with increasing temperature. Steady state {CH}4 production reached a first maximum at about 40 °C, but increased further up to at least 50 °C, suggesting the presence of thermophilic microorganisms whose activity was apparently masked when Fe had not been completely reduced. The apparent activation energy of {CH}4 production at steady state ranged between 48 {kJ} mol–1 and 65 {kJ} mol–1.},

This study aimed to investigate how methanogenesis is affected by the common occurrence of these compounds, which has not been considered to date. The experiment was conducted with anoxic paddy soil microcosms receiving a humics surrogate compound (anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, {AQDS}) and three iron({III}) oxides (ferrihydrite, hematite, and magnetite) differing in crystallinity and conductivity. Ferrihydrite suppressed methanogenesis, whereas {AQDS}, hematite, and magnetite facilitated methanogenesis. {CH}4 production in co-occurring ferrihydrite + {AQDS}, hematite + {AQDS}, and magnetite + {AQDS} cultures was 4.1, 1.3, and 0.9 times greater than the corresponding cultures without {AQDS}, respectively. Syntrophic cooperation between Geobacter and Methanosarcina occurred in the methanogenesis-facilitated cultures. Experimental results suggested that the conductive characteristics of iron({III}) oxides was an important factor determining the methanogenic response to the co-occurrence of iron({III}) oxides and humics in anaerobic paddy soil. This work indicated that the type of iron({III}) oxides may significantly affect carbon cycling under anoxic conditions in natural wetlands.},

	abstract = {Methane ({CH}4) is an important greenhouse gas because it has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) by mass over a century. Recent calculations suggest that atmospheric {CH}4 emissions have been responsible for approximately 20\% of Earth/'s warming since pre-industrial times. Understanding how {CH}4 emissions from ecosystems will respond to expected increases in global temperature is therefore fundamental to predicting whether the carbon cycle will mitigate or accelerate climate change. Methanogenesis is the terminal step in the remineralization of organic matter and is carried out by strictly anaerobic Archaea. Like most other forms of metabolism, methanogenesis is temperature-dependent. However, it is not yet known how this physiological response combines with other biotic processes (for example, methanotrophy, substrate supply, microbial community composition) and abiotic processes (for example, water-table depth) to determine the temperature dependence of ecosystem-level {CH}4 emissions. It is also not known whether {CH}4 emissions at the ecosystem level have a fundamentally different temperature dependence than other key fluxes in the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. Here we use meta-analyses to show that seasonal variations in {CH}4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems exhibit an average temperature dependence similar to that of {CH}4 production derived from pure cultures of methanogens and anaerobic microbial communities. This average temperature dependence (0.96 electron volts ({eV})), which corresponds to a 57-fold increase between 0 and 30°C, is considerably higher than previously observed for respiration (approximately 0.65 {eV}) and photosynthesis (approximately 0.3 {eV}). As a result, we show that both the emission of {CH}4 and the ratio of {CH}4 to {CO}2 emissions increase markedly with seasonal increases in temperature. Our findings suggest that global warming may have a large impact on the relative contributions of {CO}2 and {CH}4 to total greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial wetlands and rice paddies.},

	abstract = {Iron plaque occurs on the roots of most wetland and submersed aquatic plant species and is a large pool of oxidized Fe({III}) in some environments. Because plaque formation in wetlands with circumneutral {pH} has been largely assumed to be an abiotic process, no systematic effort has been made to describe plaque-associated microbial communities or their role in plaque deposition. We hypothesized that Fe({II})-oxidizing bacteria ({FeOB}) and Fe({III})-reducing bacteria ({FeRB}) are abundant in the rhizosphere of wetland plants across a wide range of biogeochemical environments. In a survey of 13 wetland and aquatic habitats in the Mid-Atlantic region, {FeOB} were present in the rhizosphere of 92\% of the plant specimens collected (n = 37), representing 25 plant species. In a subsequent study at six of these sites, bacterial abundances were determined in the rhizosphere and bulk soil using the most probable number technique. The soil had significantly more total bacteria than the roots on a dry mass basis (1.4 × 109 cells/g soil vs. 8.6 × 107 cells/g root; p {\textless} 0.05). The absolute abundance of aerobic, lithotrophic {FeOB} was higher in the soil than in the rhizosphere (3.7 × 106/g soil vs. 5.9 × 105/g root; p {\textless} 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between these habitats in terms of relative abundance (∼1\% of the total cell number). In the rhizosphere, {FeRB} accounted for an average of 12\% of all bacterial cells while in the soil they accounted for {\textless} 1\% of the total bacteria. We concluded that {FeOB} are ubiquitous and abundant in wetland ecosystems, and that {FeRB} are dominant members of the rhizosphere microbial community. These observations provide a strong rationale for quantifying the contribution of {FeOB} to rhizosphere Fe({II}) oxidation rates, and investigating the combined role of {FeOB} and {FeRB} in a rhizosphere iron cycle.},

The similarity of rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation rates determined with the two techniques and the absence of an adverse effect of {CH}3F on plant metabolism indicated that the {CH}3F inhibition flux chamber technique was a useful tool for measuring rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation in freshwater wetlands. A significant seasonal pattern for both plant species as well as a significant difference between the plant species were observed. Light or dark conditions had no significant effect on rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation. When averaged over the growing season, {CH}4 oxidation in the rhizosphere of bulrush and reed reduced the potential {CH}4 flux by 34.7\%±20.3 and 16.1\%±7.86, respectively. Highest {CH}4 oxidation rates were noted early in the plant growth cycle with more than 55\% of the generated methane being oxidised in the bulrush system. Methane oxidation rates were lowest after plants matured. The difference in rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation capacity between reed and bulrush and the seasonal variation for reed were confirmed by a series of slurry incubations.

	abstract = {Nearly 5000 chamber measurements of {CH}4 flux were collated from 21 sites across the United Kingdom, covering a range of soil and vegetation types, to derive a parsimonious model that explains as much of the variability as possible, with the least input requirements. Mean fluxes ranged from −0.3 to 27.4 nmol {CH}4 m−2 s−1, with small emissions or low rates of net uptake in mineral soils (site means of −0.3 to 0.7 nmol m−2 s−1) and much larger emissions from organic soils (site means of −0.3 to 27.4 nmol m−2 s−1). Less than half of the observed variability in instantaneous fluxes could be explained by independent variables measured. The reasons for this include measurement error, stochastic processes and, probably most importantly, poor correspondence between the independent variables measured and the actual variables influencing the processes underlying methane production, transport and oxidation. When temporal variation was accounted for, and the fluxes averaged at larger spatial scales, simple models explained up to ca. 75\% of the variance in {CH}4 fluxes. Soil carbon, peat depth, soil moisture and {pH} together provided the best sub-set of explanatory variables. However, where plant species composition data were available, this provided the highest explanatory power. Linear and nonlinear models generally fitted the data equally well, with the exception that soil moisture required a power transformation. To estimate the impact of changes in peatland water table on {CH}4 emissions in the United Kingdom, an emission factor of +0.4 g {CH}4 m−2 yr−1 per cm increase in water table height was derived from the data.},

To get a better understanding of the controls of {CH}4 production we used microcosms planted with rice and studied emission, porewater chemistry and the potential role of ferric iron as a competitive electron acceptor. {CH}4 emission from rice microcosms peaked after 60 d when porewater {CH}4 concentrations in the unrooted soil also reached their highest values. A rooted soil layer with low {CH}4 concentrations and high Eh developed on top of the lower unrooted soil. When measured in vitro, methanogenesis in the rooted upper soil layer started at a very low rate, but increased dramatically after 25–40 d when ferric iron reduction had stopped. If mixtures of the upper soil layer and of lower unrooted soil layer were incubated, the length of the lag phase depended linearly on the proportion of soil from the upper layer. In the lower soil layer, methanogenesis started immediately at high rates. The gross mineralization rate in both soil layers was identical. There was no difference or change in the numbers of culturable methanogens between the two layers, either at the beginning or at the end of the experiment. Hence, the lag phase in methane production by the upper soil layer may have been caused either by competition for substrates or by direct inhibition, but not by population growth. O2 release from rice roots controls methanogenesis in the rooted upper soil layer either directly or by the oxidation of ferrous iron. Our data suggest that the presence of ferric iron, resulting from the input of oxygen via the roots, results in a shift of electron flow from methanogenesis to ferric iron reduction. This interaction can be assumed to be of major importance for the biogeochemistry of {CH}4 in wetland ricefields.},

	abstract = {High concentrations (20–75 µmol cm‒3) of amorphous Fe({III}) oxide were observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus effusus rhizosphere sediments of a freshwater wetland in the southeastern United States. Incubation experiments demonstrated that microbial Fe({III}) oxide reduction suppressed sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in surface sediments and mediated ≥40\% of depth-integrated (0–10 cm) unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism, compared to ≤10\% for sulfate reduction. In situ {CO}2 and {CH}4 flux measurements verified that nonmethanogenic pathways accounted for ∼50\% of unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism. Lower (∼10-fold) rates of dark/anaerobic {CH}4 flux from experimental vegetated cores relative to unvegetated controls suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited in the Juncus rhizosphere, in which active Fe({III}) oxide reduction was indicated by the presence of low but readily detectable levels of dissolved and solid-phase Fe({II}). Fe({III}) oxide reduction accounted for 65\% of total carbon metabolism in rhizosphere sediment incubations, compared to 22\% for methanogenesis. In contrast, methanogenesis dominated carbon metabolism (72\% of total) in experimental unvegetated sediment cores. The high Fe({III}) oxide concentrations and reduction rates observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus rhizosphere sediments were perpetuated by rapid Fe({III}) regeneration via oxidation of Fe({II}) compounds coupled to O2 input from the overlying water and plant roots, respectively. The results indicate that Fe({III}) oxide reduction could mediate a considerable amount of organic carbon oxidation and significantly suppress {CH}4 production in freshwater wetlands situated within globally extensive iron-rich tropical and subtropical soil regimes.},

	abstract = {For decades, ecosystem scientists have used global warming potentials ({GWPs}) to compare the radiative forcing of various greenhouse gases to determine if ecosystems have a net warming or cooling effect on climate. On a conceptual basis, the continued use of {GWPs} by the ecological community may be untenable because the use of {GWPs} requires the implicit assumption that greenhouse gas emissions occur as a single pulse; this assumption is rarely justified in ecosystem studies. We present two alternate metrics—the sustained-flux global warming potential ({SGWP}, for gas emissions) and the sustained-flux global cooling potential ({SGCP}, for gas uptake)—for use when gas fluxes persist over time. The {SGWP} is generally larger than the {GWP} (by up to {\textasciitilde}40\%) for both methane and nitrous oxide emissions, creating situations where the {GWP} and {SGWP} metrics could provide opposing interpretations about the climatic role of an ecosystem. Further, there is an asymmetry in methane and nitrous oxide dynamics between persistent emission and uptake situations, producing very different values for the {SGWP} vs. {SGCP} and leading to the conclusion that ecosystems that take up these gases are very effective at reducing radiative forcing. Although the new metrics are more realistic than the {GWP} for ecosystem fluxes, we further argue that even these metrics may be insufficient in the context of trying to understand the lifetime climatic role of an ecosystem. A dynamic modeling approach that has the flexibility to account for temporally variable rates of greenhouse gas exchange, and is not limited by a fixed time frame, may be more informative than the {SGWP}, {SGCP}, or {GWP}. Ultimately, we hope this article will stimulate discussion within the ecosystem science community about the most appropriate way(s) of assessing the role of ecosystems as regulators of global climate.},

Emission from wetlands is a significant component of the atmospheric {CH}4 budget, releasing 145 Tg {CH}4 annually to the atmosphere, or about 25\% of total emissions from all anthropogenic and natural sources. Wetlands are characterized by a subsurface, anaerobic zone of {CH}4 production by methanogenic bacteria and an surficial, aerobic zone of {CH}4 oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. Wetlands transfer {CH}4 to the atmosphere by diffusion, ebullition, and by transport through arenchymous vascular plants. However, about 20 to 40\% of the {CH}4 produced in anaerobic wetland soils is oxidized in the rhizosphere and in surficial oxic layers during diffusive transport to the soil surface. Rates of {CH}4 emission in wetlands are commonly 100 mg m-2 day-1, and represent the net effect of production and consumption.

	abstract = {Methane fluxes measured in a eutrophic peat meadow in The Netherlands dominated by vascular plants showed high spatial and temporal variability. To elucidate this variability as well as the underlying processes, various measurement techniques were used: soil gradients of methane concentrations, the chamber method, and the eddy covariance technique. Additionally, soil temperature at multiple depths, soil water level, root depth, carbon dioxide fluxes, incoming radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, friction velocity latent, heat fluxes, and living biomass were monitored. A comparison of the measurement techniques showed that: (a) the soil gradient method and the chamber method showed comparable methane fluxes only at a site with low water table and shallow roots, while at other sites methane fluxes were underestimated with the soil gradient method by an order of magnitude; (b) a footprint analysis showed that the chamber method and eddy covariance showed similar methane fluxes for the different land elements (dry land, wet land, and ditches plus borders). However, when up-scaling the chamber measurements over time using a regression model based on soil temperature, methane emissions were overestimated by 37\% compared to the eddy covariance data. The chamber method was the best technique to assess spatial variability, while eddy covariance was best for assessing temporal variability as well as up-scaling. The soil gradient method for methane fluxes should be used with great care, and probably generates reliable results only in areas with low water table and shallow roots. Both the chamber method and eddy covariance showed significant spatial variability, which was best explained by soil water level in combination with root depth patterns. Together, these variables probably determined the net methane production and the available mechanisms for methane transport to atmosphere. The methane fluxes showed strong temporal variability at different scales: diurnal cycles, significant day-to-day variability, and seasonal variations. Clear diurnal cycles of methane fluxes were observed synchronous to incoming radiation, latent heat and net ecosystem exchange, but not synchronous to temperature. This suggested that stomatal opening and/or pressurized convective throughflow were important mechanisms for gas transport through plants. The variability at the day-to-day scale was best explained by soil temperature below the water level combined with soil water level. Highest methane fluxes were observed during summer and lowest fluxes during autumn and winter. The vegetation density together with temperature and length of day-light probably determined this seasonality. Also, temporal variability varied spatially, probably due to the water table and root depth.},

	abstract = {Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of {CO}2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of {CH}4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas ({GHG}) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of {CO}2, {CH}4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials ({GWP}'s).  The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. {GHG} fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system ({CO}2) and flux chamber measurements ({CH}4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of {CO}2 ({NEE}) was −446+±83 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2004, −311±58 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2005 and −232±57 g m−2 yr−1 for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869±668 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2004, 866±666 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2005 and 924±711 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2006. {CH}4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted {CH}4 emissions were 31.27±20.40 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2005 and 32.27±21.08 g C m−2 yr−1 for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and {CH}4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m−2 yr−1). The carbon-balance consisted for the largest part of {CO}2 uptake, {CO}2 respiration and {CH}4 emission from water saturated land and water. {CO}2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while {CH}4 fluxes have increased. In {GWP}'s the area was a small net {GHG} sink given as {CO}2-equiv. of −86 g m−2 yr−1 (over a 100-year period).},

The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of −14.7 °C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg {CH}4 m−2 day−1 during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3\% of the total flux measured during June–October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m−2. This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14\% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.},

	abstract = {1. Wetland ecosystems may, besides having considerable economical value, increase landscape biodiversity and function as traps for nutrients from land to freshwater- and marine systems. As a result of these features, wetlands are nowadays often protected and restored, and many countries have even initiated wetland construction programmes. 2. In the present study, we aim at increasing the knowledge on how to improve the design of a wetland with respect to both biodiversity and nutrient retention, by analysing physical, chemical and biological features of a large set of constructed wetlands. 3. Our results show that a combination of the wetland features, namely shallow depth, large surface area and high shoreline complexity are likely to provide a high biodiversity of birds, benthic invertebrates and macrophytes and to have high nitrogen retention, whereas a small, deep wetland is likely to be more efficient in phosphorus retention, but less valuable in terms of biodiversity. 4. Hence, among the features used to design new wetlands, area, depth and shoreline complexity have fundamental, and sometimes conflicting, effects on nutrient retention and biodiversity. This means that there are, within limits, possibilities to direct the ecosystem function of a specific wetland in desired directions.},

Sulfate, sulfide, and sulfate containing peat dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) from an afforested site were added in reduced and oxidized redox state. Sulfate and acetate concentrations were analyzed, bacterial sulfate reduction ({BSR}) and {CO}2 and {CH}4 production quantified, and results analyzed by {ANOVA}. {DOM} was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy and analyzed for trace elements. {CH}4 production (116 nmol cm−3 d−1) and {BSR} rate (102 nmol cm−3 d−1) were similar in ‘controls’. {BSR} in treatments ‘sulfate’ (73 nmol cm−3 d−1) and ‘sulfide’ (118 nmol cm−3 d−1) did not significantly differ from ‘controls’ but addition of {DOM} significantly diminished {BSR} down to 0.4 nmol cm−3 d−1 (Kruskal Wallis test, p {\textless} 0.05). {CH}4 production decreased with sulfate (16\%, not significant) and sulfide addition (40\%, p {\textless} 0.05) and {CO}2 production increased (treatment ‘sulfate’, p {\textless} 0.05). Addition of all {DOM} extracts (67 mg L−1) almost completely suppressed methanogenesis and {CO}2 production (p {\textless} 0.05), but acetate accumulated compared to the control (p {\textless} 0.05). The {DOM} applied contained carboxylic, aromatic and phenolic moieties and metal contents typical for peat humic substances. We conclude that a toxic effect of the intensely humified {DOM} occurred on both methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria ({SRB}) but not on fermenting microorganisms. As yet it is not clear what might cause such a toxic effect of {DOM} on {SRB} and archaea.},

	abstract = {Methane–climate interactions are reasonably well understood; the biogeochemical controls on net methane fluxes are less so. Within anoxic soils, alternative electron acceptors such as iron and humic substances influence microbial metabolic function, and thus affect the amount of carbon lost as methane ({CH}4). We present three years of data from wet sedge tundra landscapes near Barrow, Alaska that show an inverse relationship between dissolved iron and {CH}4 concentrations. We found increasing organic layer thickness related to increases in active layer organic matter content, and decreases in both bulk density and extractable iron. Organic layer depth was also a good proxy for carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and {CH}4 dynamics, with increasing organic layer depths relating to lower dissolved iron, higher amounts of dissolved {CH}4, and lower {CO}2:{CH}4 ratios in the upper active layer. Net {CH}4 fluxes were also significantly suppressed following the experimental addition of iron and humic acids. Iron and humic acid treatment effects were indistinguishable for {CH}4 net flux; in contrast, post-treatment {CH}4 fluxes were an average of 0.74-fold the control treatment flux rates. These results suggest that in-situ {CH}4 production is tied to alternative electron acceptor availability, and that organic layer thickness is a good predictor of biogeochemical controls on {CH}4 fluxes in wet-sedge Arctic Alaskan tundra.},

	abstract = {The partitioning of net ecosystem exchange of {CO}2 ({NEE}) into photosynthesis and respiration can be challenging and is often associated with assumptions that yield unknown amounts of uncertainty, thereby hindering model development. This occurs because we are inferring two pieces of information from one equation and measurement, {NEE}. While there are multiple methods for partitioning {NEE}, each has unique limitations that are difficult to evaluate as these techniques are often not implemented simultaneously. Here we present an analysis of multiple partitioning methods (a non-linear regression model known as the Reichstein method, artificial neural networks ({ANN}), stable carbon isotopes, and soil respiration (Rsoil) measurements) under ideal field conditions. We measured ecosystem-scale fluxes of stable C isotopes via a new quantum cascade laser ({QCL}) spectrometer and paired those measurements with a biophysical model {CANVEG} in order to close a system of equations and solve for gross primary productivity ({GPP}) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Isotope-partitioned {GPP} and Reco were on average 10–13\% lower than Reichstein- and {ANN}-partitioned {GPP} and Reco. These results suggest that the Reichstein and {ANN} approaches, which use nighttime {NEE} to infer daytime Reco, may be overestimating Reco and {GPP} during the day. This may be attributed to higher plant respiration rates at night compared to the day, otherwise known as the Kok effect. As isotope measurements and theory become more accessible to diverse ecosystems it will grow to be more than a benchmarking technique and into a valuable means of improving understanding of carbon cycling. Future studies are encouraged to evaluate these techniques in increasingly complex ecosystems to determine when significant differences appear between partitioning methods and how those differences influence modeling of terrestrial carbon budgets.},

	abstract = {The potential for microbially mediated anaerobic redox cycling of iron (Fe) was examined in a first-generation enrichment culture of freshwater wetland sediment microorganisms. Most probable number enumerations revealed the presence of significant populations of Fe({III})-reducing (approximately 10(8) cells ml(-1)) and Fe({II})-oxidizing, nitrate-reducing organisms (approximately 10(5) cells ml(-1)) in the freshwater sediment used to inoculate the enrichment cultures. Nitrate reduction commenced immediately following inoculation of acetate-containing (approximately 1 {mM}) medium with a small quantity (1\% v/v) of wetland sediment, and resulted in the transient accumulation of {NO}(2)(-) and production of a mixture of gaseous end-products (N(2)O and N(2)) and {NH}(4)(+). Fe({III}) oxide (high surface area goethite) reduction took place after {NO}(3)(-) was depleted and continued until all the acetate was utilized. Addition of {NO}(3)(-) after Fe({III}) reduction ceased resulted in the immediate oxidation of Fe({II}) coupled to reduction of {NO}(3)(-) to {NH}(4)(+). No significant {NO}(2)(-) accumulation was observed during nitrate-dependent Fe({II}) oxidation. No Fe({II}) oxidation occurred in pasteurized controls. Microbial community structure in the enrichment was monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S {rDNA} and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S {rRNA}, as well as by construction of 16S {rDNA} clone libraries for four different time points during the experiment. Strong similarities in dominant members of the microbial community were observed in the Fe({III}) reduction and nitrate-dependent Fe({II}) oxidation phases of the experiment, specifically the common presence of organisms closely related ({\textgreater}or= 95\% sequence similarity) to the genera Geobacter and Dechloromonas. These results indicate that the wetland sediments contained organisms such as Geobacter sp. which are capable of both dissimilatory Fe({III}) reduction and oxidation of Fe({II}) with reduction of {NO}(3)(-) to {NH}(4)(+). Our findings suggest that microbially catalysed nitrate-dependent Fe({II}) oxidation has the potential to contribute to a dynamic anaerobic Fe redox cycle in freshwater sediments.},

	abstract = {The stability of levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is threatened by continued subsidence of Delta peat islands. Up to 6 meters of land-surface elevation has been lost in the 150 years since Delta marshes were leveed and drained, primarily from oxidation of peat soils. Flooding subsided peat islands halts peat oxidation by creating anoxic soils, but net accumulation of new material in restored wetlands is required to recover land-surface elevations.  We investigated the subsidence reversal potential of two 3 hectare, permanently flooded, impounded wetlands re-established on a deeply subsided field on Twitchell Island. The shallower wetland (design water depth 25 cm) was almost completely colonized by dense emergent marsh vegetation within two years; whereas, the deeper wetland (design water depth 55 cm) which developed spatially variable depths as a result of  heterogeneous colonization by emergent vegetation, still had some areas remaining as open water after nine years. Changes in land-surface elevation were quantified using repeated sedimentation-erosion table measurements. New material accumulating in the wetlands was sampled by coring.Land-surface elevations increased by an average of 4 cm/yr in both wetlands from 1997 to 2006; however, the rates at different sites in the wetlands ranged from -0.5 to +9.2 cm/yr.  Open water areas of the deeper wetland without emergent vegetation had the lowest rates of land-surface elevation gain. The greatest rates occurred in areas of the deeper wetland most isolated from the river water inlets, with dense stands of emergent marsh vegetation (tules and cattails). Vegetated areas of the deeper wetland in the transition zones between open water and mature emergent stands had intermediate rates of land-surface gain, as did the entire shallower wetland. These results suggest that the dominant component contributing to land-surface elevation gain in these wetlands was accumulation of organic matter, rather than mineral sediment, and that accumulation of organic matter in emergent marshes is strongly affected by hydrologic factors. Re-established, non-tidal wetlands with managed hydrology can produce significant increases in land-surface elevations, which can help to improve levee stability and protect subsided islands from future flooding.},

	abstract = {Wetlands can influence global climate via greenhouse gas ({GHG}) exchange of carbon dioxide ({CO}2), methane ({CH}4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Few studies have quantified the full {GHG} budget of wetlands due to the high spatial and temporal variability of fluxes. We report annual open-water diffusion and ebullition fluxes of {CO}2, {CH}4, and N2O from a restored emergent marsh ecosystem. We combined these data with concurrent eddy-covariance measurements of whole-ecosystem {CO}2 and {CH}4 exchange to estimate {GHG} fluxes and associated radiative forcing effects for the whole wetland, and separately for open-water and vegetated cover types. Annual open-water {CO}2, {CH}4, and N2O emissions were 915 ± 95 g C-{CO}2 m−2 yr−1, 2.9 ± 0.5 g C-{CH}4 m−2 yr−1, and 62 ± 17 mg N-N2O m−2 yr−1, respectively. Diffusion dominated open-water {GHG} transport, accounting for {\textgreater}99\% of {CO}2 and N2O emissions, and {\textasciitilde}71\% of {CH}4 emissions. Seasonality was minor for {CO}2 emissions, whereas {CH}4 and N2O fluxes displayed strong and asynchronous seasonal dynamics. Notably, the overall radiative forcing of open-water fluxes (3.5 ± 0.3 kg {CO}2-eq m−2 yr−1) exceeded that of vegetated zones (1.4 ± 0.4 kg {CO}2-eq m−2 yr−1) due to high ecosystem respiration. After scaling results to the entire wetland using object-based cover classification of remote sensing imagery, net uptake of {CO}2 (−1.4 ± 0.6 kt {CO}2-eq yr−1) did not offset {CH}4 emission (3.7 ± 0.03 kt {CO}2-eq yr−1), producing an overall positive radiative forcing effect of 2.4 ± 0.3 kt {CO}2-eq yr−1. These results demonstrate clear effects of seasonality, spatial structure, and transport pathway on the magnitude and composition of wetland {GHG} emissions, and the efficacy of multiscale flux measurement to overcome challenges of wetland heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Methane ({CH}4) emissions and carbon uptake in temperate freshwater wetlands act in opposing directions in the context of global radiative forcing. Large uncertainties exist for the rates of {CH}4 emissions making it difficult to determine the extent that {CH}4 emissions counteract the carbon sequestration of wetlands. Urban temperate wetlands are typically small and feature highly heterogeneous land cover, posing an additional challenge to determining their {CH}4 budget.
The data analysis approach we introduce here combines two different {CH}4 flux measurement techniques to overcome scale and heterogeneity problems and determine the overall {CH}4 budget of a small, heterogeneous, urban wetland landscape. Temporally intermittent point measurements from non-steady-state chambers provided information about patch-level heterogeneity of fluxes, while continuous, high temporal resolution flux measurements using the eddy-covariance ({EC}) technique provided information about the temporal dynamics of the fluxes. Patch-level scaling parameterization was developed from the chamber data to scale eddy covariance data to a ‘fixed-frame’, which corrects for variability in the spatial coverage of the eddy covariance observation footprint at any single point in time. By combining two measurement techniques at different scales, we addressed shortcomings of both techniques with respect to heterogeneous wetland sites.
We determined that fluxes observed by the two methods are statistically similar in magnitude when brought to the same temporal and spatial scale. We also found that open-water and macrophyte-covered areas of the wetland followed similar phenological cycles and emitted nearly equivalent levels of {CH}4 for much of the year. However, vegetated wetland areas regularly exhibited a stronger late-summer emission peak, possibly due to {CH}4 transport through mature vegetation vascular systems. Normalizing the eddy covariance data to a fixed-frame allowed us to determine the seasonal {CH}4 budget of each patch and the overall site. Overall, the macrophyte areas had the largest {CH}4 fluxes followed by the open water areas.
Uncertainties in the final {CH}4 budget included spatial heterogeneity of {CH}4 fluxes, the tower footprint, measurement in the data to be scaled, and gap-filling. Of these, the spatial placement of the chambers provided the largest source of uncertainty in {CH}4 estimates. This reinforces the need to utilize site-level measurements when estimating {CH}4 fluxes from wetlands as opposed to using only up-scaled point measurements.},

	abstract = {Estuarine freshwater marshes can act as an important ecosystem for carbon storage and flux because of its strategic position in a watershed. We monitored {CH}4 and {CO}2 fluxes in Old Woman Creek, an estuarine wetland of Lake Erie, Ohio. The eddy covariance ({EC}) technique was used to measure fluxes of {CH}4 and {CO}2 continuously during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. Simultaneously, monthly sampling of gas exchange was conducted using non-steady state chambers in four distinct land-cover types in the wetland: open water, emergent vegetation (Typha spp.), floating vegetation (Nelumbo spp.) and mud flats. Chambers and {EC} measurements were combined to provide estimates of the continuous contributions of each land cover to the total methane emissions of the wetland. In addition, water and meteorological measurements were used to determine the most important environmental drivers of methane flux in the wetland. We found an average rate of emission from the Typha patch, the most abundant vegetated land cover, of 219.4g {CH}4 Cm−2y−1, which was much higher than rates reported in similar emergent vegetation types in other wetlands. Mud flats had the highest rates of {CH}4 emission, followed by Nelumbo and Typha patches, and open water. Mud flats contributed 6.8\% of the total {CH}4 emissions of the wetland despite occupying only 1.5\% of the wetland area, whereas open water contributed 16.1\% despite occupying 47\% of the wetland area. Water temperature and wind speed were the strongest environmental drivers of {CH}4 flux to the atmosphere. Carbon fluxes were strongly correlated to methane fluxes. Fluctuating water levels above the wetland’s surface had a weak effect on overall {CH}4 emissions in the wetland, with stronger effects during the night than during the day. Providing an empirical model that predicts the influence of different environmental drivers {CH}4 emissions in the wetland can aid in the design of estuarine wetlands that retain nutrients and reduce coastal eutrophication while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.},

	abstract = {Agricultural practices mostly influence methane ({CH}4) emissions from rice field, which must be controlled for maintaining the ecosystem balance. No-tillage farming with chemical amendments having electron acceptors could be an effective mitigation strategy in {CH}4 emissions from irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. An experiment was conducted in Korean paddy field under tillage and no-tillage farming practices with silicate iron slag amendments (1–4Mgha−1) for suppressing {CH}4 emissions and maintaining rice productivity. It was found that {CH}4 emissions from the no-tillage rice field significantly decreased as compared to that of tilled field, irrespective of silicate amendments. The total seasonal {CH}4 flux from the control tillage and control no-tillage plots were recorded 38.1 and 27.9gm−2, respectively, which were decreased by 20\% and 36\% with 4Mgha−1 silicate amendment. Silicate fertilization (4Mgha−1) with no-tillage system decreased total seasonal {CH}4 flux by 54\% as compared to that of control tillage plot. This is most likely due to the higher concentrations of active iron and free iron oxides in the no-tilled rice field as compared to that of tilled field under silicate fertilization, which acted as electron acceptors and contributed to decrease {CH}4 emission. In addition, the improved soil porosity and redox potential, rice plant growth parameters such as active tillering rate, root volume and porosity, etc. in combination increased the rhizosphere oxygen concentrations and eventually suppressed {CH}4 emission during the rice growing season. The leaf photosynthetic rate was significantly increased with 4Mgha−1 silicate amendment, which ultimately increased grain yield by 18\% and 13\% in the tilled and no-tilled rice field, respectively. {CH}4 flux showed a strong positive correlation with the availability of soil organic carbon, while there were negative correlations with soil porosity, soil {pH}, soil Eh, and the content of active iron and free iron oxides in soil.},

	abstract = {In tidal marshes, spatial and temporal variability in the importance of microbial metabolic pathways influences ecosystem-level processes such as soil carbon storage, the regeneration of inorganic nutrients, and the production of atmospherically important trace gases. We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe({III}) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, {USA}, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe({III}) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe({III}) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe({III}) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron–sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe({III}) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plant-mediated processes. In midsummer, Fe({III}) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe({III}) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe({III}) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils. Our data suggested that variations in microbial metabolic pathways were regulated by physiochemical factors at the brackish site and plant activity at the freshwater site. Plant regulation of Fe({III}) reduction is a largely unstudied mechanism by which plants influence wetland carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.},

	abstract = {We compared the reactivity and microbial reduction potential of Fe({III}) minerals in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil to test the hypothesis that rapid Fe({III}) reduction rates in wetland soils are explained by rhizosphere processes. The rhizosphere was defined as the area immediately adjacent to a root encrusted with Fe({III})-oxides or Fe plaque, and non-rhizosphere soil was {\textgreater}0.5 cm from the root surface. The rhizosphere had a significantly higher percentage of poorly crystalline Fe (66+/-7\%) than non-rhizosphere soil (23+/-7\%); conversely, non-rhizosphere soil had a significantly higher proportion of crystalline Fe (50+/-7\%) than the rhizosphere (18+/-7\%, P{\textless}0.05 in all cases). The percentage of poorly crystalline Fe({III}) was significantly correlated with the percentage of {FeRB} (r=0.76), reflecting the fact that poorly crystalline Fe({III}) minerals are labile with respect to microbial reduction. Abiotic reductive dissolution consumed about 75\% of the rhizosphere Fe({III})-oxide pool in 4 h compared to 23\% of the soil Fe({III})-oxide pool. Similarly, microbial reduction consumed 75-80\% of the rhizosphere pool in 10 days compared to 30-40\% of the non-rhizosphere soil pool. Differences between the two pools persisted when samples were amended with an electron-shuttling compound ({AQDS}), an Fe({III})-reducing bacterium (Geobacter metallireducens), and organic carbon. Thus, Fe({III})-oxide mineralogy contributed strongly to differences in the Fe({III}) reduction potential of the two pools. Higher amounts of poorly crystalline Fe({III}) and possibly humic substances, and a higher Fe({III}) reduction potential in the rhizosphere compared to the non-rhizosphere soil, suggested the rhizosphere is a site of unusually active microbial Fe cycling. The results were consistent with previous speculation that rapid Fe cycling in wetlands is due to the activity of wetland plant roots.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem and biogeochemical responses to anthropogenic stressors are the result of complex interactions between plants and microbes. A mechanistic understanding of how plant traits influence microbial processes is needed in order to predict the ecosystem-level effects of natural or anthropogenic change. This is particularly true in wetland ecosystems, where plants alter the availability of both electron donors (e.g., organic carbon) and electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen and ferric iron), thereby regulating the total amount of anaerobic respiration and the production of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. In this study, we examined how plant traits associated with plant inputs of carbon (photosynthesis and biomass) and oxygen (root porosity and ferric iron on roots) to mineral soils relate to microbial competition for organic carbon and, ultimately, methane production. Plant productivity was positively correlated with microbial respiration and negatively correlated to methane production. Root porosity was relatively constant across plant species, but belowground biomass, total biomass, and the concentration of oxidized (ferric) iron on roots varied significantly between species. As a result the size of the total root oxidized iron pool varied considerably across plant species, scaling with plant productivity. Large pools of oxidized iron were related to high {CO}2:{CH}4 ratios during microbial respiration, indicating that as plant productivity and biomass increased, microbes used non-methanogenic respiration pathways, most likely including the reduction of iron oxides. Taken together these results suggest that increased oxygen input from plants with greater biomass can offset any potential stimulation of methanogenic microbes from additional carbon inputs. Because the species composition of plant communities influences both electron donor and acceptor availability in wetland soils, changes in plant species as a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance have the potential to trigger profound effects on microbial processes, including changes in anaerobic decomposition rates and the proportion of mineralized carbon emitted as the greenhouse gas methane.},
