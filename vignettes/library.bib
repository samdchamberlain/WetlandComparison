	abstract = {The higher-order scalar concentration fluctuation properties are examined in the context of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory for a variety of greenhouse gases that have distinct and separate source/sink locations along an otherwise ideal micrometeorological field site. Air temperature and concentrations of water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane were measured at high frequency (10 Hz) above a flat and extensive peat-land soil in the San Joaquin–Sacramento Delta (California, {USA}) area, subjected to year-round grazing by beef cattle. Because of the heterogeneous distribution of the sources and sinks of {CO}2 and especially {CH}4 emitted by cattle, the scaling behaviour of the higher-order statistical properties diverged from predictions based on a balance between their production and dissipation rate terms, which can obtained for temperature and H2O during stationary conditions. We identify and label these departures as ‘exogenous’ because they depend on heterogeneities and non-stationarities induced by boundary conditions on the flow. Spectral analysis revealed that the exogenous effects show their signatures in regions with frequencies lower than those associated with scalar vertical transport by turbulence, though the two regions may partially overlap in some cases. Cospectra of vertical fluxes appear less influenced by these exogenous effects because of the modulating role of the vertical velocity at low frequencies. Finally, under certain conditions, the presence of such exogenous factors in higher-order scalar fluctuation statistics may be ‘fingerprinted’ by a large storage term in the mean scalar budget.},

	abstract = {Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration ({ET}) can be difficult to interpret and use for validating model calculations in the presence of land cover heterogeneity. Land surface fluxes, soil moisture (θ), and surface temperatures (Ts) data were collected by an eddy correlation-based tower located at the Orroli (Sardinia) experimental field (covered by woody vegetation, grass, and bare soil) from April 2003 to July 2004. Two Quickbird high-resolution images (summer 2003 and spring 2004) were acquired for depicting the contrasting land cover components. A procedure is presented for estimating {ET} in heterogeneous ecosystems as the residual term of the energy balance using Ts observations, a two-dimensional footprint model, and the Quickbird images. Two variations on the procedure are successfully implemented: a proposed two-source random model (2SR), which treats the heat sources of each land cover component separately but computes the bulk heat transfer coefficient as spatially homogeneous, and a common two-source tile model. For 2SR, new relationships between the interfacial transfer coefficient and the roughness Reynolds number are estimated for the two bare soil–woody vegetation and grass–woody vegetation composite surfaces. The {ET} versus θ relationships for each land cover component were also estimated, showing that that the woody vegetation has a strong tolerance to long droughts, transpiring at rates close to potential for even the driest conditions. Instead, the grass is much less tolerant to θ deficits, and the switch from grass to bare soil following the rainy season had a significant impact on {ET}.},

The proposed model was based on a combination of Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model results and dimensional analysis. The main advantage of this model is its ability to analytically relate atmospheric stability, measurement height, and surface roughness length to flux and footprint. Flux estimation by the proposed model was in good agreement with those calculated by detailed Eulerian and Lagrangian models. Measured water vapor fluxes collected along a downwind transect of a transition from a desert to an irrigated potato site were also used to assess the proposed model performance in the field. It was found that the model well reproduced the measured flux evolution with downwind distance.},

	abstract = {It is necessary to partition eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange into its offsetting gross fluxes, canopy photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration, to understand the biophysical controls on the net fluxes. And independent estimates of canopy photosynthesis (G) and ecosystem respiration (R) are needed to validate and parametrize carbon cycle models that are coupled with climate and ecosystem dynamics models. Yet there is a concern that carbon flux partitioning methods may suffer from spurious correlation because derived values of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration both contain common information on net carbon fluxes at annual time scales.
We hypothesized that spurious correlation among canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration can be minimized using day–night conditional sampling of {CO}2 exchange; daytime fluxes are dominated by photosynthesis and nighttime fluxes are dominated by respiration. To test this hypothesis, we derived explicit equations that quantify the degree of spurious correlation between photosynthesis and respiration. Theoretically, day and night samples of net carbon exchange share a different common variable, daytime ecosystem respiration, and the degree of spurious correlation depends upon the variance of this shared variable.
We then applied this theory to ideal measurements of carbon exchange of over a vigorous, irrigated, and frequently harvested alfalfa field in the sunny and windy region of California, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where soil {CO}2 efflux is strong. In this case, we found that the correlation coefficient between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration was −0.79. This relatively high correlation between canopy photosynthesis and respiration was mostly real as the degree of spurious correlation was only −0.32.
We then expanded this analysis to the {FLUXNET} database that spans a spectrum of climate and plant functional types. We found, on average, that the correlation between gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, using day–night sampling, was close to minus one (−0.828 ± 0.130). For perspective, a large fraction of this correlation was real, as the degree of spurious correlation (Eq. (22)) was −0.526. We conclude that the potential for spurious correlation between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration across the {FLUXNET} database was moderate. Looking across the database, we found that the least negative spurious correlations coefficients (\&gt;−0.3) were associated with seasonal deciduous forests. The most negative spurious correlations coefficients (\&lt;−0.7) were associated with evergreen forests found in boreal climates.},

We determine the large sample distribution for both estimators and show that the maximal-overlap estimator is more efficient for a class of processes of interest in the physical sciences. We discuss methods for determining an approximate confidence interval for the wavelet variance. We demonstrate through Monte Carlo experiments that the large sample distribution for the maximal-overlap estimator is a reasonable approximation even for the moderate sample size of 128 observations. We apply our proposed methodology to a series of observations related to vertical shear in the ocean.},

	shorttitle = {Greenhouse carbon balance of wetlands},
	abstract = {Carbon fixation under wetland anaerobic soil conditions provides unique conditions for long-term storage of carbon into histosols. However, this carbon sequestration process is intimately linked to methane emission from wetlands. The potential contribution of this emitted methane to the greenhouse effect can be mitigated by the removal of atmospheric {CO}2 and storage into peat. The balance of {CH}4 and {CO}2 exchange can provide an index of a wetland’s greenhouse gas (carbon) contribution to the atmosphere. Here, we relate the atmospheric global warming potential of methane ({GWPM}) with annual methane emission/carbon dioxide exchange ratio of wetlands ranging from the boreal zone to the near-subtropics. This relationship permits one to determine the greenhouse carbon balance of wetlands by their contribution to or attenuation of the greenhouse effect via {CH}4 emission or {CO}2 sink, respectively. We report annual measurements of the relationship between methane emission and net carbon fixation in three wetland ecosystems. The ratio of methane released to annual net carbon fixed varies from 0.05 to 0.20 on a molar basis. Although these wetlands function as a sink for {CO}2, the 21.8-fold greater infrared absorptivity of {CH}4 relative to {CO}2({GWPM}) over a relatively short time horizon (20 years) would indicate that the release of methane still contributes to the overall greenhouse effect. As {GWPM} decreases over longer time horizons (100 years), our analyses suggest that the subtropical and temperate wetlands attenuate global warming, and northern wetlands may be perched on the “greenhouse compensation” point. Considering a 500-year time horizon, these wetlands can be regarded as sinks for greenhouse gas warming potential, and thus attenuate the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Humid tropical forests support large stocks of surface soil carbon (C) that exhibit high spatial variability over scales of meters to landscapes (km). Reactive minerals and organo-metal complexes are known to contribute to C accumulation in these ecosystems, although potential interactions with environmental factors such as oxygen (O2) availability have received much less attention. Reducing conditions can potentially contribute to C accumulation, yet anaerobic metabolic processes such as iron (Fe) reduction can also drive substantial C losses. We tested whether these factors could explain variation in soil C (0–10 and 10–20 cm depths) over multiple spatial scales in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using reduced iron (Fe({II})) concentrations as an index of reducing conditions across sites differing in vegetation, topographic position, and/or climate. Fine root biomass and Fe({II}) were the best overall correlates of site (n = 6) mean C concentrations and stocks from 0 to 20 cm depth (r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Litterfall decreased as reducing conditions, total and dead fine root biomass, and soil C increased among sites, suggesting that decomposition rates rather than C inputs regulated soil C content at the landscape scale. Strong relationships between Fe({II}) and dead fine root biomass suggest that reducing conditions suppressed particulate organic matter decomposition. The optimal mixed-effects regression model for individual soil samples (n = 149) showed that aluminum (Al) and Fe in citrate/ascorbate and oxalate extractions, Fe({II}), fine root biomass, and interactions between Fe({II}) and Al explained most of the variation in C concentrations (pseudo R2 = 0.82). The optimal model of C stocks was similar but did not include fine root biomass (pseudo R2 = 0.62). In these models, soil C concentrations and stocks increased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Al and oxalate-extractable Fe. However, soil C decreased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Fe, an index of Fe susceptible to anaerobic microbial reduction. At the site scale (n = 6), ratios of citrate/ascorbate to oxalate-extractable Fe consistently decreased across a landscape O2 gradient as C increased. We suggest that the impact of reducing conditions on organic matter decomposition and the presence of organo-metal complexes and C sorption by short-range order Fe and Al contribute to C accumulation, whereas the availability of an Fe pool to sustain anaerobic respiration in soil microsites partially attenuates soil C accumulation in these ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The availability of particulate Fe({III}) to iron reducing microbial communities in sediments and soils is generally inferred indirectly by performing chemical extractions. In this study, the bioavailability of mineral-bound Fe({III}) in intertidal sediments of a eutrophic estuary is assessed directly by measuring the kinetics and extent of Fe({III}) utilization by the iron reducing microorganism Shewanella putrefaciens, in the presence of excess electron donor. Microbial Fe({III}) reduction is compared to chemical dissolution of iron from the same sediments in buffered ascorbate-citrate solution ({pH} 7.5), ascorbic acid ({pH} 2), and 1M {HCl}. The results confirm that ascorbate at near-neutral {pH} selectively reduces the reactive Fe({III}) pool, while the acid extractants mobilize additional Fe({II}) and less reactive Fe({III}) mineral phases. Furthermore, the maximum concentrations of Fe({III}) reducible by S. putrefaciens correlate linearly with the iron concentrations extracted by buffered ascorbate-citrate solution, but not with those of the acid extractions. However, on average, only 65\% of the Fe({III}) reduced in buffered ascorbate-citrate solution can be utilized by S. putrefaciens, probably due to physical inaccessibility of the remaining fraction of reactive Fe({III}) to the cells. While the microbial and abiotic reaction kinetics further indicate that reduction by ascorbate at near-neutral {pH} most closely resembles microbial reduction of the sediment Fe({III}) pool by S. putrefaciens, the results also highlight fundamental differences between chemical reductive dissolution and microbial utilization of mineral-bound ferric iron.},

	shorttitle = {Suppression of methanogenesis by dissimilatory Fe({III})-reducing bacteria in tropical rain forest soils},
	abstract = {Tropical forests are an important source of atmospheric methane ({CH}4), and recent work suggests that {CH}4 fluxes from humid tropical environments are driven by variations in {CH}4 production, rather than by bacterial {CH}4 oxidation. Competition for acetate between methanogenic archaea and Fe({III})-reducing bacteria is one of the principal controls on {CH}4 flux in many Fe-rich anoxic environments. Upland humid tropical forests are also abundant in Fe and are characterized by high organic matter inputs, steep soil oxygen (O2) gradients, and fluctuating redox conditions, yielding concomitant methanogenesis and bacterial Fe({III}) reduction. However, whether Fe({III})-reducing bacteria coexist with methanogens or competitively suppress methanogenic acetate use in wet tropical soils is uncertain. To address this question, we conducted a process-based laboratory experiment to determine if competition for acetate between methanogens and Fe({III})-reducing bacteria influenced {CH}4 production and C isotope composition in humid tropical forest soils. We collected soils from a poor to moderately drained upland rain forest and incubated them with combinations of 13C-bicarbonate, 13C-methyl labeled acetate (13CH3COO−), poorly crystalline Fe({III}), or fluoroacetate. {CH}4 production showed a greater proportional increase than Fe2+ production after competition for acetate was alleviated, suggesting that Fe({III})-reducing bacteria were suppressing methanogenesis. Methanogenesis increased by approximately 67 times while Fe2+ production only doubled after the addition of 13CH3COO−. Large increases in both {CH}4 and Fe2+ production also indicate that the two process were acetate limited, suggesting that acetate may be a key substrate for anoxic carbon (C) metabolism in humid tropical forest soils. C isotope analysis suggests that competition for acetate was not the only factor driving {CH}4 production, as 13C partitioning did not vary significantly between 13CH3COO− and 13CH3COO−+Fe({III}) treatments. This suggests that dissimilatory Fe({III})-reduction suppressed both hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis. These findings have implications for understanding the {CH}4 biogeochemistry of highly weathered wet tropical soils, where {CH}4 efflux is driven largely by {CH}4 production.},

	abstract = {Soils are large sources of atmospheric greenhouse gases, and both the magnitude and composition of soil gas emissions are strongly controlled by redox conditions. Though the effect of redox dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions has been well studied in flooded soils, less research has focused on redox dynamics without total soil inundation. For the latter, all that is required are soil conditions where the rate of oxygen (O2) consumption exceeds the rate of atmospheric replenishment. We investigated the effects of soil anaerobiosis, generated with and without flooding, on greenhouse gas emissions and redox-sensitive biogeochemistry. We collected a Histosol from a regularly flooded peatland pasture and an Ultisol from a humid tropical forest where soil experiences frequent low redox events. We used a factorial design of flooding and anaerobic dinitrogen (N2) headspace treatments applied to replicate soil microcosms. An N2 headspace suppressed carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions by 50\% in both soils. Flooding, however, led to greater anaerobic {CO}2 emissions from the Ultisol. Methane emissions under N2 were also significantly greater with flooding in the Ultisol. Flooding led to very low N2O emissions after an initial pulse in the Histosol, while higher emission rates were maintained in control and N2 treatments. We conclude that soil greenhouse gas emissions are sensitive to the redox effects of O2 depletion as a driver of anaerobiosis and that flooding can have additional effects independent of O2 depletion. We emphasize that changes to the soil diffusive environment under flooding impacts transport of all gases, not only O2, and changes in dissolved solute availability under flooding may lead to increased mineralization of C.},

	abstract = {Wetland rice soils from Italy (Pavia) and the Philippines (Bugallon, Luisiana, Maligaya) were incubated under anoxic conditions at 31 different temperatures ranging from 4.7 °C to 49.5 °C. Production of {CO}2 was most intensive at the beginning of the incubation (0–4 days) and was predominantly coupled to the reduction of free Fe({III}). The optimum temperature for these processes was between 32 °C and 41 °C. After 9–16 days, {CO}2 production rates had decreased and the available Fe({III}) had been completely reduced at the optimum temperatures. However, Fe({III}) was still available at temperatures below and above the optimum. Maximum {CH}4 production rates were observed after 4–16 days (except in soil from Maligaya) with temperature optima between 32 °C and 41 °C, similar to those for {CO}2 production and Fe reduction. Since ongoing Fe reduction is known to suppress {CH}4 production, the temperature range of optimum {CH}4 production was restricted to those temperatures at which Fe({III}) had already been depleted. Nevertheless, the temperature characteristics of both {CO}2 and {CH}4 production often exhibited two temperature optima at some time during the incubation, suggesting a complex pattern of adaptation of the methanogenic microbial community to temperature. When available Fe({III}) was completely depleted by anoxic pre-incubation at 30 °C, {CH}4 was produced at a constant rate (steady state conditions) which increased with increasing temperature. Steady state {CH}4 production reached a first maximum at about 40 °C, but increased further up to at least 50 °C, suggesting the presence of thermophilic microorganisms whose activity was apparently masked when Fe had not been completely reduced. The apparent activation energy of {CH}4 production at steady state ranged between 48 {kJ} mol–1 and 65 {kJ} mol–1.},

This study aimed to investigate how methanogenesis is affected by the common occurrence of these compounds, which has not been considered to date. The experiment was conducted with anoxic paddy soil microcosms receiving a humics surrogate compound (anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, {AQDS}) and three iron({III}) oxides (ferrihydrite, hematite, and magnetite) differing in crystallinity and conductivity. Ferrihydrite suppressed methanogenesis, whereas {AQDS}, hematite, and magnetite facilitated methanogenesis. {CH}4 production in co-occurring ferrihydrite + {AQDS}, hematite + {AQDS}, and magnetite + {AQDS} cultures was 4.1, 1.3, and 0.9 times greater than the corresponding cultures without {AQDS}, respectively. Syntrophic cooperation between Geobacter and Methanosarcina occurred in the methanogenesis-facilitated cultures. Experimental results suggested that the conductive characteristics of iron({III}) oxides was an important factor determining the methanogenic response to the co-occurrence of iron({III}) oxides and humics in anaerobic paddy soil. This work indicated that the type of iron({III}) oxides may significantly affect carbon cycling under anoxic conditions in natural wetlands.},

However, its importance broadly in non-flooded upland terrestrial ecosystems is unknown. We measured Fe reduction in soil samples from an annual grassland, a drained peatland, and a humid tropical forest. We incubated soil slurries in an anoxic glovebox for 5.5 days and added sodium acetate daily at rates up to 0.4 mg C·(g soil)−1·d−1. Soil moisture, poorly crystalline Fe oxide concentrations, and Fe({II}) concentrations differed among study sites in the following order: annual grassland {\textless} drained peatland {\textless} tropical forest (P {\textless} 0.001 for all characteristics). All of the soil samples demonstrated high Fe reduction potential with maximum rates over the course of the incubation averaging 1706 ± 66, 2016 ± 12, and 2973 ± 115 μg Fe·(g soil)−1·d−1 (mean ± {SE}) for the tropical forest, annual grassland, and drained peatland, respectively. Our results suggest that upland soils from diverse ecosystems have the potential to exhibit high short-term rates of Fe reduction that may play an important role in driving soil biogeochemical processes during periods of anaerobiosis.},

	abstract = {Methane ({CH}4) is an important greenhouse gas because it has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) by mass over a century. Recent calculations suggest that atmospheric {CH}4 emissions have been responsible for approximately 20\% of Earth/'s warming since pre-industrial times. Understanding how {CH}4 emissions from ecosystems will respond to expected increases in global temperature is therefore fundamental to predicting whether the carbon cycle will mitigate or accelerate climate change. Methanogenesis is the terminal step in the remineralization of organic matter and is carried out by strictly anaerobic Archaea. Like most other forms of metabolism, methanogenesis is temperature-dependent. However, it is not yet known how this physiological response combines with other biotic processes (for example, methanotrophy, substrate supply, microbial community composition) and abiotic processes (for example, water-table depth) to determine the temperature dependence of ecosystem-level {CH}4 emissions. It is also not known whether {CH}4 emissions at the ecosystem level have a fundamentally different temperature dependence than other key fluxes in the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. Here we use meta-analyses to show that seasonal variations in {CH}4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems exhibit an average temperature dependence similar to that of {CH}4 production derived from pure cultures of methanogens and anaerobic microbial communities. This average temperature dependence (0.96 electron volts ({eV})), which corresponds to a 57-fold increase between 0 and 30°C, is considerably higher than previously observed for respiration (approximately 0.65 {eV}) and photosynthesis (approximately 0.3 {eV}). As a result, we show that both the emission of {CH}4 and the ratio of {CH}4 to {CO}2 emissions increase markedly with seasonal increases in temperature. Our findings suggest that global warming may have a large impact on the relative contributions of {CO}2 and {CH}4 to total greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial wetlands and rice paddies.},

	abstract = {Iron plaque occurs on the roots of most wetland and submersed aquatic plant species and is a large pool of oxidized Fe({III}) in some environments. Because plaque formation in wetlands with circumneutral {pH} has been largely assumed to be an abiotic process, no systematic effort has been made to describe plaque-associated microbial communities or their role in plaque deposition. We hypothesized that Fe({II})-oxidizing bacteria ({FeOB}) and Fe({III})-reducing bacteria ({FeRB}) are abundant in the rhizosphere of wetland plants across a wide range of biogeochemical environments. In a survey of 13 wetland and aquatic habitats in the Mid-Atlantic region, {FeOB} were present in the rhizosphere of 92\% of the plant specimens collected (n = 37), representing 25 plant species. In a subsequent study at six of these sites, bacterial abundances were determined in the rhizosphere and bulk soil using the most probable number technique. The soil had significantly more total bacteria than the roots on a dry mass basis (1.4 × 109 cells/g soil vs. 8.6 × 107 cells/g root; p {\textless} 0.05). The absolute abundance of aerobic, lithotrophic {FeOB} was higher in the soil than in the rhizosphere (3.7 × 106/g soil vs. 5.9 × 105/g root; p {\textless} 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between these habitats in terms of relative abundance (∼1\% of the total cell number). In the rhizosphere, {FeRB} accounted for an average of 12\% of all bacterial cells while in the soil they accounted for {\textless} 1\% of the total bacteria. We concluded that {FeOB} are ubiquitous and abundant in wetland ecosystems, and that {FeRB} are dominant members of the rhizosphere microbial community. These observations provide a strong rationale for quantifying the contribution of {FeOB} to rhizosphere Fe({II}) oxidation rates, and investigating the combined role of {FeOB} and {FeRB} in a rhizosphere iron cycle.},

Ex Steud.) and bulrush (Scirpus lacustris L.), was quantified using the methylfluoride ({CH}3F) inhibition and anoxic/oxic flux chamber techniques. The similarity of rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation rates determined with the two techniques and the absence of an adverse effect of {CH}3F on plant metabolism indicated that the {CH}3F inhibition flux chamber technique was a useful tool for measuring rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation in freshwater wetlands. A significant seasonal pattern for both plant species as well as a significant difference between the plant species were observed. Light or dark conditions had no significant effect on rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation. When averaged over the growing season, {CH}4 oxidation in the rhizosphere of bulrush and reed reduced the potential {CH}4 flux by 34.7\%±20.3 and 16.1\%±7.86, respectively. Highest {CH}4 oxidation rates were noted early in the plant growth cycle with more than 55\% of the generated methane being oxidised in the bulrush system. Methane oxidation rates were lowest after plants matured. The difference in rhizospheric {CH}4 oxidation capacity between reed and bulrush and the seasonal variation for reed were confirmed by a series of slurry incubations. Slurry incubations also showed a significant decrease of potential {CH}4 oxidation as a function of depth in sediment.},

	abstract = {Nearly 5000 chamber measurements of {CH}4 flux were collated from 21 sites across the United Kingdom, covering a range of soil and vegetation types, to derive a parsimonious model that explains as much of the variability as possible, with the least input requirements. Mean fluxes ranged from −0.3 to 27.4 nmol {CH}4 m−2 s−1, with small emissions or low rates of net uptake in mineral soils (site means of −0.3 to 0.7 nmol m−2 s−1) and much larger emissions from organic soils (site means of −0.3 to 27.4 nmol m−2 s−1). Less than half of the observed variability in instantaneous fluxes could be explained by independent variables measured. The reasons for this include measurement error, stochastic processes and, probably most importantly, poor correspondence between the independent variables measured and the actual variables influencing the processes underlying methane production, transport and oxidation. When temporal variation was accounted for, and the fluxes averaged at larger spatial scales, simple models explained up to ca. 75\% of the variance in {CH}4 fluxes. Soil carbon, peat depth, soil moisture and {pH} together provided the best sub-set of explanatory variables. However, where plant species composition data were available, this provided the highest explanatory power. Linear and nonlinear models generally fitted the data equally well, with the exception that soil moisture required a power transformation. To estimate the impact of changes in peatland water table on {CH}4 emissions in the United Kingdom, an emission factor of +0.4 g {CH}4 m−2 yr−1 per cm increase in water table height was derived from the data.},
